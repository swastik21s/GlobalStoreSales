# GlobalStoreSales
 
I'm excited to share my latest project on the Global Super Store Data. In this project, I utilized tools like MS Excel and Power BI. The main KPIs showcased in this project are:

The regions where the store is operating.
Total sales done.
Total quantity of products sold.
Total number of orders returned.
Average delivery days for products.
Top 5 profit-making products.
Top 5 loss-making products.
Sales done in each country.
I would appreciate feedback on what else can be improved in the dashboard.
